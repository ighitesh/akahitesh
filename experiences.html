											<h3>1 - Currently as Department Academic Mentor at IITB</h3>
											<p>The second-year students at IITB have a third-year mentor from the same branch. I also had one, and the help my mentor provided was exactly what I needed in my second year, whether it was for time management or academic support. My mentor always assisted me in providing important information. This is when I realized that sharing experiences with someone who is also walking the same path is incredibly helpful. It not only provides them with help as a senior but also as a friend with whom they can freely share their problems and seek assistance. The new academic transitions from the first to the second year, as well as difficulties in time management, can all be addressed by a mentor who may have faced similar situations in their own time. My mentor became more of a friend rather than just a mentor, and I strive to make my mentees feel the same way about me. </p>

											<h3>2 - As a Media Convener in Institute Technical Council at IITB</h3>
											<p>My journey started because of one of the most common things that first-year students face, also known as FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). So, because of FOMO, I became the media convener, thinking that there wouldn't be much work. However, I was wrong; this position of responsibility turned out to be quite hectic. Despite the workload, I had the opportunity to make good friends and get to know many people, gaining insights into their different perspectives on various things. Additionally, I had the chance to connect with some cool seniors. I believe this position is the only one in IITB that led the seniors to give me an opportunity to attend the Inter IIT Tech Meet 11.0 as part of the media team from IITB. The event was hosted by IIT Kanpur this time, and I was extremely happy about it. This journey as a media convener has been truly amazing for me at IITB, as it has also helped me improve my personality. Once again, I cannot forget being a part of the Institute Technical Council at IIT Bombay as the media convener.</p>
